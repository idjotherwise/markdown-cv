## Occupation

`Jan. 2019 ‐ present`
__MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER (FREELANCE)__

- Leading a series of machine learning projects to supplement intelligence from survey data, mainly revolving around Natural Language Processing projects.
- Trained a sentiment analysis model to classify free-text responses as positive, negative or neutral responses. Fine-tuned a large language model (BERT) on our own labeled data to obtain a sentiment analysis model which works for English, French and German text. Deployed on Heroku as an API endpoint with FastAPI after converting the model to an optimised ONNX file format.

__DATA SCIENTIST__

- In charge of writing statistical reports for clients summarising survey results with statistical tests. Reports written using Knitr (an R package) with our own custom R package to connect to our database of survey responses.
